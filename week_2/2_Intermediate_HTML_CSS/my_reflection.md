# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards help keep all pages readable and similar. It makes them familiar to the readers and easier to navigate. But I think it also means people have less customization

the HTML 5 elements make the code look cleaner and are easier to read. They are so common, that it is nice to have them built in. It also helps organize code your work visually by thinking in terms of these new elements.

reset.css is necessary because it forces all browers to reset their stylesheets to nothing. This helps avoid brower differences.

I generally use google chrome out of habit. I think it is frustrating as a developer if not every brower renders the websites the same because it makes it a lot more tedious to have to consider each and every browser when creating a site. Why don't some browers support certain things?
