# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


My Biggest Time management challenge during phase 0 so far has simply been in the start. I am currently on the road crossing 2 timezones during the most crucial part of the whole phase, so it has been bumpy. I accidentally missed my first GPS by forgetting to account for the different timezone.

I will combat this by double checking times and building in more time for working on DBC material. I think this will be easier now that I am going to be in one place (with internet!) for a while.

I will start scheduling DBC work time into my phone and set alarms for that time.

My Plan for Phase 0 is to learn as much as possible so that I start Phase 1 ready to go. I also want to gather good resources that I will be able to use throughout DBC.
