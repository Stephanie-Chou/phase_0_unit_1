# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive webdesign is web design that resizes to match the media device or screen size on which it is being viewed. I think it is a great practice because it provides less work for the user.

I think smartphones have forced web design to be less text heavy because a lot of text is hard to read on a tiny screen. It also changes how navigation between pages work. Touch interfaces have also changed how people interact with a web page. I think this will continue to effect design.

I think visually impaired people need options for greater color contrast (color blindness concious color schemes for example)

I really enjoyed trying to test the web design on smaller screen sizes.
