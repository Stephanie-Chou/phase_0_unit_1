# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Document Object Model (DOM) provides a way to display and store documents in a browser. The DOM represents the page as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. The DOM is independent of any programming language and can be manipulated using JS. I don't really understand how DOM works at a deeper level. How is it implemented and why does it work?

It's nice that it works across browers.

I prefer using a normal text editor. While Chrome Web tools is nice for small changes like color, it is a pain to use. It is small and you have to double click and doesn't feel totally natural. If Sublime interface could replace the Chrome Web Tools interface, that would be perfect!
