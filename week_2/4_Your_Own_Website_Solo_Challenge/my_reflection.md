Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned a lot about responsive design. I realize that touch screens and mouse clicks are very different interfaces so I would like to learn more about that. I also learned to appreciate the differences between all the browsers.

It is a lot of fun to work on the site. I admit I get antsy working on the wireframe because I just want to see how the website would look finished.
To plan, I google 'best personal websites' and try to incorporate ideas from what I see. I learn best from examples.

I would like to get more creative with the image gallery. I also want to include more responsive design for the text for a few different screens sizes, like a tablet.

It is difficult to make the responsive design for every single sized screen because they are very small changes in size between each one.
