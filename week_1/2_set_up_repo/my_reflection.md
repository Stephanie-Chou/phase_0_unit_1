At the top of the github page you will see your username. Next to your username is a '+'. click the '+' and in the dropdown menu, click 'Create Repository'. In this new page, You must give your repository a name the click the button that says 'Create repository.'

You will now see that you can 'Set up in Desktop.' click that button and it will launch GitHub locally on your computer. Click on the new repository you have created and select 'clone'

Open source means that many people are contributing to the information and code you have access to.

Open Source is great because it generally also means free. With coding, more heads are better than one and often the best solutions float to the top by the general community consensus. I generally trust open sources.

using licenses is important for software especially for businesses.
