* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I had GitHub set up on my computer from a previous project.
git is version control. It maintains a history of your code which you can go back and view or change.
GitHub is the storage system that uses git.

Version Control maintains a history of your code. It allows you to make changes and save them. It also allows you to go back to previous versions your code. GitHub stores the latest version of that code

version control is very helpful for developers because developing is highly collaborative. with version control, each member of the dev team can have their own local (personal) version of the code to which they can make changes without interfering with the work of their co-developers.

How does git decide what to do if there are conflicts between two versions?
