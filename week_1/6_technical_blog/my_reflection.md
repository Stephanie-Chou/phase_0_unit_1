Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I like blogs if they are informative, but I generally don't have much time to read them. I have tried to write blogs before. But it actually takes a surprising amount of time to create a thoughtful post.
